The gameplay of 2048 is combining similar numbered tiles to get the combined 
result. Each swipe in a certain direction would shift the entire grid in that 
direction, combining like tiles and generating a random '2' tile every time 
something moved. The goal was to eventually be able to combine numbers and reach 
2048 (2^11) before all the grids filled up and no more moves were possible. 

This was implemented and tested on a breadboard using the following parts:
    Atmega1284 microcontroller
    Nokia 5110 LCD screen
    6 rgb anode leds
    1 74HC59 shift register
    Sparkfun TLC5940 PWM driver 
    button inputs
